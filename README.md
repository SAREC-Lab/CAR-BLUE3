## Environment Setup

1. Clone this repo under directory `catkin_ws/src/`

2. Run `catkin_make` to install this package

## Usage

1. Run roscore on the laptop: `roscore`.
2. On the laptop, write down the ip address by `ipconfig`.
3. On Turtlebot, set up the Rospy master for turtlebot by `export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<master_server_ip_address_on_ND_guest>:11311`.
4. Bring up the turtlebot by `roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch`.
5. (Optional) If you want to put it in a saved map for visualization, run `export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger` and `roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation turtlebot3_navigation.launch map_file:=$HOME/map.yaml`. Be sure to perform Initial Pose Estimation.
6. Run the script in this repo with `python src/main.py` on laptop.


## Documentation

### Domain Specific Language
We used JSON to format our task plans because JSON is a lightweight data formatting language that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse the input. Python, the language of our parser, has a json library which makes it easy to handle JSON objects and files. We utilize functions from this library to easily read in the task plan. 
Our JSON file has a command and a value. The command represents what the car will be doing. We realized that we can simplify our commands to "drive" "circle" and "stop" by sending in some other values as a part of the value array. For example, for drive we send in a distance and a direction where the direction is a binary value such that forward movement corresponds to 1 and reverse movement corresponds to 0. The same idea is used with circle where leftward movement is 1 and rightward movement is 0. We also realized that a turn is just a quarter circle so we used this knowledge to buff up our circle utils to take in the number of revolutions. Thus, as a part of our JSON input in the value array for command "circle" we have the radius, left/right direction, forward/reverse direction, and number of revolutions where a turn is 0.25 revolutions and a full circle is 1. For "stop", the value is just the number of seconds to remain stopped. 

### Requirements and Designs
R1: Create a state machine to handle any driving orders given to a MUSHR car<br />
D1: Create code that parses & distributes movement plans to the state machine<br />
D2: The car can move forward and backward from input<br />
D3: The car can make simple turns from input<br />
D4: More complex movements, such as three-point turns and moving in a circle

## Legacy

### Real Car

1. Run `roslaunch mushr_base teleop.launch`
2. Run `roslaunch CAR-BLUE3 path_publisher.launch`
    1. To specify the plan file, `roslaunch CAR-BLUE3 path_publisher.launch plan_file:='/path/to/plan.txt'`

### Simulation
1. `roslaunch mushr_sim teleop.launch`
2. `rosrun rviz rviz -d $HOME/catkin_ws/src/mushr/mushr_utils/rviz/default.rviz`
3. `roslaunch CAR-BLUE3 path_publisher.launch`

*Donâ€™t forget: $ shutdown now*


### Push Code to the Car
1. Pull Code to the local repo
2. Connect to Car's wifi
3. Go to the parent directory `cd ..` and run `rsync -rlptzv --progress --delete --exclude=.git ./CAR-BLUE3 "robot@10.42.0.1:~/catkin_ws/src"`

### How to communicate across cars/turtlebots
We just need one `roscore` running as the master server, and all the other clients can just pub/sub to this server by `export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<master_server_ip_address_on_ND_guest>:11311`.

We believe running the server on laptop would be the best choice so far.
