## Environment Setup

1. Clone this repo under directory `catkin_ws/src/`

2. Run `catkin_make` to install this package

## How to Run the Car

### Real Car

1. Run `roslaunch mushr_base teleop.launch`
2. Run `roslaunch CAR-BLUE3 path_publisher.launch`
    1. To specify the plan file, `roslaunch CAR-BLUE3 path_publisher.launch plan_file:='/path/to/plan.txt'`

### Simulation
1. `roslaunch mushr_sim teleop.launch`
2. `rosrun rviz rviz -d $HOME/catkin_ws/src/mushr/mushr_utils/rviz/default.rviz`
3. `roslaunch CAR-BLUE3 path_publisher.launch`

*Donâ€™t forget: $ shutdown now*


### Push Code to the Car
1. Pull Code to the local repo
2. Connect to Car's wifi
3. Go to the parent directory `cd ..` and run `rsync -rlptzv --progress --delete --exclude=.git ./CAR-BLUE3 "robot@10.42.0.1:~/catkin_ws/src"`

## Documentation

### Requirements and Designs
R1: Create a state machine to handle any driving orders given to a MUSHR car<br />
D1: Create code that parses & distributes movement plans to the state machine<br />
D2: The car can move forward and backward from input<br />
D3: The car can make simple turns from input<br />
D4: More complex movements, such as three-point turns and moving in a circle

### Testing
In order to test the program, we largely followed a trial-and-error style of approach; develop a segment of the code, then test it on the car, see what it does, then develop based on results. For example, for the simplest prompt - drive - we started by testing that the car would drive if prompted; after we knew it would drive, we tested if it would drive the right distance. After knowing it went the right distance, we tried going in different directions (in the case of reversing, due to our distance formula, it would reverse infinitely until it was interrupted on the first trial). We followed this method for each possible prompt - making sure the car would do its instructions for the correct duration, going the right distance, in the right direction, and at the right time. <br />
Upon having every possible prompt satisfied, we implemented it with the state machine, and imported it on the car. After a few more tests ensuring that the state machine was functional (using test JSON files as input), the project was effectively completed.
