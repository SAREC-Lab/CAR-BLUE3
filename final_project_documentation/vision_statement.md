## Vision Statement

Follow the Leader uses a **main turtlebot** to guide other **autonomous vehicles**. The **main turtlebot** moves toward a **GPS location** sent to it from the user using a simple application. The **main turtlebot** then begins to move toward that direction, navigating with **LiDAR** technology to avoid obstacles. The other **autonomous vehicles** follow the **main turtlebot** after it has determined how to avoid the obstacles ahead. Usage examples include delivering materials with large **autonomous vehicles** that follow the guidance of the **main turtlebot**. 

## Glossary 
- Main Turtlebot: the turtlebot that will use LiDAR to lead the other
  autonomous vehicles; the main turtlebot is powered by ROS
- Autonomous Vehicle: a vehicle that is powered not by human action but by
  following the **main turtlebot**
- GPS Location: the coordinates on Earth based on satellites of the desired
  location to travel to 
- LiDAR: Light Detection and Ranging is a remote sensing method that uses
  pulsing lasers to measure ranges to objects around
